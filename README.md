## Description
This program is made for hydrological scientists to work with a database of hydrological information.
After research reises, scientists bring PRS files (in fact, this is a regular text file), which contains various meteorological information, chemical parameters and temperature, sea water salinity. These files need to be processed and entered into the database.

After entering the data into the database, scientists can make queries on ships and flights and upload the resulting sample to a CSV format for further work with information.
